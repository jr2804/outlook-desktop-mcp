**Turn your running Outlook Desktop into an MCP server.** No Microsoft Graph API, no Entra app registration, no OAuth tokens — just your local Outlook and the authentication you already have.

Any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) can then send emails, manage your calendar, create tasks, handle attachments, and more — all through your existing Outlook session.

## Quick Start

**1. Install** (requires Python 3.12+):

```bash
pip install outlook-desktop-mcp
```

**2. Register with Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- outlook-desktop-mcp
```

**3. Open Outlook and start a Claude Code session.** That's it — tools are available immediately.

## How It Works — Platform Routing

When the server starts, it checks which operating system it is running on and takes one of two paths:

```
                        outlook-desktop-mcp starts
                                  |
                          sys.platform check
                         /                  \
                   "win32"                "darwin"
                      |                      |
              ┌───────┴────────┐    ┌────────┴────────┐
              │  server.py     │    │  server_mac.py   │
              │  COM Bridge    │    │  AppleScript     │
              │  (29 tools)    │    │  Bridge          │
              │                │    │  (22 tools)      │
              └───────┬────────┘    └────────┬─────────┘
                      |                      |
              OUTLOOK.EXE via         Microsoft Outlook
              COM / STA thread        via osascript
                      |                      |
              Exchange / M365         Exchange / M365
```

**Both paths use your locally running Outlook app and its existing authenticated session.** No cloud credentials, no Graph API tokens — the server inherits whatever account Outlook is signed into.

### Why two paths?

Windows Outlook (Classic) exposes a rich COM automation interface — the Outlook Object Model (`MSOUTL.OLB`). This has been the standard way to programmatically control Outlook on Windows for over 20 years. It provides deep access to mail rules, categories, MAPI properties, and the full folder hierarchy.

Mac Outlook does not support COM. Instead, it exposes an AppleScript dictionary that can be driven via the `osascript` command. The AppleScript interface covers the core operations — email, calendar, tasks — but does not expose rules, categories, or certain advanced MAPI features. This is a limitation of what Microsoft chose to include in Outlook for Mac's scripting dictionary, not a limitation of this project.

The server is structured as two parallel implementations with identical tool names and signatures, so MCP clients see the same interface regardless of platform. Tools that are not available on a given platform are simply not registered.

## Requirements

### Windows

- **Outlook Desktop (Classic)** — the `OUTLOOK.EXE` that comes with Microsoft 365 / Office. The new "modern" Outlook (`olk.exe`) does **not** support COM
- **Python 3.12+** (x64 or ARM64)
- **Outlook must be running** when the MCP server starts

Both x64 and ARM64 Windows are supported. On ARM64, all dependencies (`pywin32`, `mcp`, `pydantic-core`, `cryptography`, `cffi`, `rpds-py`) have prebuilt `win_arm64` wheels — see the [ARM64 install notes](#arm64-windows) below for the one extra `pip` flag you need.

#### Outlook "Programmatic Access" security prompts

When the MCP server first touches Outlook's COM API, Outlook may show a dialog: *"A program is trying to access email address information stored in Outlook"* (the Object Model Guard / Programmatic Access prompt). This is Outlook's protection against malicious automation.

You have three options:

1. **Click "Allow access for 10 minutes"** every time you start a session. Fine for casual use.
2. **Get the antivirus status to "Valid"** in *File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Programmatic Access*. When that line reads `Valid`, the "Never warn me about suspicious activity" radio becomes selectable and the prompts go away. On most personal machines with current Defender this works out of the box.
3. **Apply the registry policy** in [`docs/suppress-outlook-oom-prompts.reg`](docs/suppress-outlook-oom-prompts.reg). From an **elevated** PowerShell or Command Prompt (Win+X → *Terminal (Admin)*), run:

   ```powershell
   reg import "C:\path\to\outlook-desktop-mcp\docs\suppress-outlook-oom-prompts.reg"
   ```

   Then fully quit Outlook (check Task Manager for stray `OUTLOOK.EXE` processes) and reopen it. This writes `AdminSecurityMode=3` and approves all `PromptOOM*` categories under `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security`, which Outlook honors regardless of AV status. On Intune/MDM-managed corporate devices, `HKCU\Software\Policies\...\Outlook` is locked and the HKLM keys may be overwritten on next policy sync — if `reg import` fails or the prompts come back, ask IT to push the equivalent settings via Group Policy.

> **Windows 11 ARM64 note:** Defender does not register with Outlook's `IOfficeAntiVirus` interface on ARM64, so Trust Center shows *"Antivirus status: Invalid"* and the *"Never warn me about suspicious activity"* radio stays greyed out **even when Outlook is launched as Administrator**. Option 2 is unavailable on ARM64; the `reg import` from option 3 is the only durable suppression path.

### macOS

- **Microsoft Outlook for Mac** — version 16.x or later
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Outlook must be running** when the MCP server starts

#### Required macOS permissions

The first time a tool runs, macOS will show **two permission prompts** that you must approve:

1. **Privacy & Automation** — a system dialog asks: *"python3.12 wants to control Microsoft Outlook"*. Click **Allow** to let the server send AppleScript commands to Outlook.

2. **Accessibility** — to read your Exchange/M365 inbox, the server uses macOS UI scripting (System Events). This requires Accessibility access for `python3.12`:
   - Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
   - Find **python3.12** in the list (it appears after the first prompt)
   - Toggle it **on**

   Without Accessibility enabled, calendar, tasks, and local folder tools will work, but listing Exchange inbox messages will return empty results.

Both permissions are one-time setup — macOS remembers them for future sessions.

**Total: 33 tools on Windows, 26 tools on macOS.** (Some Windows-only capabilities — accounts, rules, categories, meeting response, OOF status query — are not exposed on macOS.)

## Architecture Details

### Windows: COM Bridge (`backends/win/bridge.py`)

All Outlook COM operations run on a dedicated thread using the Single-Threaded Apartment (STA) model, as required by COM. The async MCP event loop dispatches tool calls to this thread via a queue and awaits results, keeping COM threading rules respected and the MCP protocol non-blocking.

```
MCP tool call (async)
  → bridge.call(func, args)
    → queued to STA thread
      → func(outlook, namespace, args) executes on COM thread
    → result returned via threading.Event
  → JSON response back to MCP client
```

Each tool's inner function receives the live `Outlook.Application` and `MAPI.Namespace` COM objects and works directly with the Outlook Object Model — `GetItemFromID`, `CreateItem`, `Items.Restrict` with DASL filters, and so on.

### macOS: AppleScript Bridge (`backends/mac/bridge.py`)

Each tool call builds an AppleScript string and executes it as a subprocess via `osascript`. There is no persistent connection — every call is stateless.

```
MCP tool call (async)
  → build AppleScript string
    → asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("osascript", "-e", script)
    → parse stdout text into structured data
  → JSON response back to MCP client
```

Each tool constructs a single AppleScript that fetches all needed data in one `osascript` call (no per-message subprocess loops). Results come back as delimited text, which the server parses into the same JSON structure the Windows server produces.

**Key differences from Windows:**

- Entry IDs on macOS are **numeric** (e.g. `42`), not hex strings. They identify items within their folder context.
- Folder references use AppleScript's **locale-independent keywords** (`inbox`, `sent items`, `drafts`, `deleted items`) rather than localized folder names.
- Search uses AppleScript's `whose` clause (e.g. `messages whose subject contains "query"`) instead of DASL filters.
- User input is escaped for safe embedding in AppleScript strings to prevent script injection.

## Install from Source

### Windows (x64)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp.git
cd outlook-desktop-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pywin32 "mcp[cli]" -e .
python .venv\Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
```

Register from source using the launcher script:

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- powershell.exe -Command "& 'C:\path\to\outlook-desktop-mcp\outlook-desktop-mcp.cmd' mcp"
```

### Windows (ARM64)

The `[cli]` extra of `mcp` transitively pulls in `cryptography`, and pip's default resolver may pick a version that lacks a `win_arm64` wheel — which then fails to build because it requires a Rust toolchain plus OpenSSL. Install without the `cli` extra and force wheels-only resolution:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp.git
cd outlook-desktop-mcp
& "C:\Program Files\Python312-arm64\python.exe" -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --only-binary=:all: pywin32 mcp
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
python .venv\Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
```

The base `mcp` package is sufficient for running the stdio server — the `[cli]` extra is only needed for the `mcp` developer CLI tools (`mcp dev`, `mcp inspector`), which aren't used at runtime.

Register from source the same way as x64:

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- powershell.exe -Command "& 'C:\path\to\outlook-desktop-mcp\outlook-desktop-mcp.cmd' mcp"
```

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp.git
cd outlook-desktop-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "mcp[cli]" -e .
```

Register from source:

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- /path/to/outlook-desktop-mcp/.venv/bin/python -m outlook_desktop_mcp
```

## Usage Examples

Once registered, just talk to Claude naturally:

- *"Show me my 10 most recent inbox emails"*
- *"Read the email from Taylor about MLADS"*
- *"Send an email to alice@example.com about the project update"*
- *"What's on my calendar this week?"*
- *"Create a meeting with bob@example.com tomorrow at 2pm for 30 minutes"*
- *"Save the attachment from that email to my Downloads folder"*
- *"Create a task to review the quarterly report, due Friday, high importance"*
- *"Mark that email as read and move it to archive"*

Windows-only examples:

- *"What categories do I have? Set this email to 'Follow-up'"*
- *"List my mail rules"*
- *"Am I set as Out of Office?"*
